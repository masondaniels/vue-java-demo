# Vue Button Demo
This is the button demo which allows a webpage to communicate with a Java backend using Vuejs & Socketio libraries.

The packages are using my manga.surf domain. I plan to rework this into the front and backend of the manga.surf website.

## GIF Output
Here's a gif output of everything working. Take note that when the client reloads the webpage, the server keeps track of the button presses.
